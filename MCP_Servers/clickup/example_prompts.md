## Reporting

## Best Practices

**Be specific:**
- Use exact list names, not descriptions
- Provide dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Specify assignees by name or "me"

**Combine operations:**
```
Create task "Design homepage mockup", assign to me, set priority to urgent, due date 2025-11-10, and add tag "design-sprint"
```

**Use search before create:**
```
Check if we already have a task for "competitor analysis" before creating a new one
```
