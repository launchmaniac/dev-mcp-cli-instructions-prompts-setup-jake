## Best Practices

**Specify repository clearly:**
```
Read CLAUDE.md from launchmaniac/launchmaniac-mcp-cli-setup
```
Not: "Read CLAUDE.md" (ambiguous if multiple repos)

**Use full paths for files:**
```
Read MCP_Servers/clickup/installation.md from launchmaniac-mcp-cli-setup
```

**Combine operations:**
```
Read the current README.md, analyze it, and create a pull request with improvements to the Getting Started section
```

## Daily Workflows

**Morning standup:**
```
Show me:
1. All commits I made yesterday
2. Open PRs awaiting my review
3. Issues assigned to me with "high" priority
```

**Documentation updates:**
```
Read all markdown files in the docs/ folder and summarize what's outdated based on recent code changes
```

**Code review:**
```
Show me the diff for PR #42 and analyze for potential bugs or improvements
```
